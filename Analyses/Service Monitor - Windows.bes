		<Description><![CDATA[This Analysis will report on the statistics stored by the&nbsp;<STRONG>Fixlet:</STRONG>&nbsp;"Invoke - Service Monitor - Windows". Specifically it will report information related to monitored services started by the BigFix Agent. 
<P>To define a service as, "Monitored" for use by this fixlet:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Create a client setting: besservicemonitor-&lt;name&gt; 
<LI>Populate the setting with a semicolon separated list of services to monitor: "<FONT size=2>BESProxyAgent;BESRelay;BESGather;BESPluginService;BESRootServer;BESWebReportsServer"</FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT size=2>This action will then check those services to make sure they are running.</FONT></P>
